## 🗂️ Project structure
```
app/
  api/explain/route.ts   # API route → GitHub fetch + Gemini summary
  components/
    home.tsx             # Hero page with CTA and Clerk auth buttons
    chat.tsx             # Chat-style page to enter URL and view summary
  chat/page.tsx          # Signed-in experience using same summary UI
  layout.tsx             # Root layout with Clerk provider
  page.tsx               # Entry → toggles Home/Chat

```

## 🔐 Environment variables
Create `.env.local` in the project root:
```
# Google Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# NextAuth (Google + Email)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://user:pass@smtp.example.com:587
EMAIL_FROM=Your App <no-reply@example.com>

# Optional: GitHub token for higher rate limits / private repos
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

## 🚀 Getting started
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Usage
1. Open the site and paste a GitHub repo URL, e.g. `https://github.com/vercel/next.js`.
2. Click "Analyze Repository 🚀".
3. Review the comprehensive analysis covering code quality, security, performance, and architecture.
4. Click "Analyze another repository" to start a new analysis.

## 🧱 Tech stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk (authentication)
- Google Gemini API
- react-markdown

## ⚠️ Limitations (current behavior)
- Only root-level files are fetched from GitHub (no recursive traversal yet).
- No streaming; summaries appear after the full response.
- No caching or rate limiting yet.
- Markdown rendering is sanitized (no raw HTML) but links open in a new tab.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- Recursive GitHub traversal with size caps and binary filtering.
- Map–reduce summarization for faster/cheaper responses.
- Streaming responses to the UI.
- Caching and simple rate limiting.
- Optional history for signed-in users.

## 🧪 Development notes
- The API handles missing commits and private/empty repos gracefully (omits last commit date).
- Ensure Clerk keys and Gemini key are set; restart dev server after changes.
