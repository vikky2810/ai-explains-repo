# üß† AI Explains This Repo

**Professional GitHub repository analysis platform** that provides deep insights into code quality, security, performance, and architecture. Unlike static analyzers, it doesn't just flag issues‚Äîit explains architecture, highlights risks, and gives developers actionable insights in plain English.

## üß© How it works
1. **Enter Repository URL**: Paste any public GitHub repository URL into the analyzer
2. **AI Analysis**: Our AI scans code quality, security, performance, and architecture, generating plain-language explanations
3. **Get Insights**: Receive detailed reports with actionable recommendations to improve your repository

> **Mission**: "Make complex repositories clear, secure, and maintainable through AI-powered explanations."

## üóÇÔ∏è Project structure
```
app/
  api/explain/route.ts   # API route ‚Üí GitHub fetch + Gemini summary
  components/
    home.tsx             # Hero page with CTA and Clerk auth buttons
    chat.tsx             # Chat-style page to enter URL and view summary
  chat/page.tsx          # Signed-in experience using same summary UI
  layout.tsx             # Root layout with Clerk provider
  page.tsx               # Entry ‚Üí toggles Home/Chat
public/                  # SVG assets
```

## üîê Environment variables
Create `.env.local` in the project root:
```
# Database (Required for user registration and authentication)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database

# NextAuth (Required for authentication)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Google OAuth (Optional - for Google sign-in)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# AI Service (Optional - for repository analysis)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional: GitHub token for higher rate limits / private repos
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

## üöÄ Getting started

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
Create `.env.local` file with the required variables (see Environment variables section above).

### 3. Set up database
The application uses PostgreSQL. You can use:
- **Neon** (recommended): Sign up at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and get your connection string
- **Local PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL locally and create a database
- **Other providers**: Any PostgreSQL-compatible database

### 4. Initialize database tables
```bash
# Run the database initialization script
pnpm tsx scripts/init-db.ts
```

### 5. Start the development server
```bash
pnpm dev
# visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Usage
1. Open the site and paste a GitHub repo URL, e.g. `https://github.com/vercel/next.js`.
2. Click "Analyze Repository üöÄ".
3. Review the comprehensive analysis covering code quality, security, performance, and architecture.
4. Click "Analyze another repository" to start a new analysis.

## üß± Tech stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk (authentication)
- Google Gemini API
- react-markdown

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (current behavior)
- Only root-level files are fetched from GitHub (no recursive traversal yet).
- No streaming; summaries appear after the full response.
- No caching or rate limiting yet.
- Markdown rendering is sanitized (no raw HTML) but links open in a new tab.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- Recursive GitHub traversal with size caps and binary filtering.
- Map‚Äìreduce summarization for faster/cheaper responses.
- Streaming responses to the UI.
- Caching and simple rate limiting.
- Optional history for signed-in users.

## üß™ Development notes
- The API handles missing commits and private/empty repos gracefully (omits last commit date).
- Ensure Clerk keys and Gemini key are set; restart dev server after changes.
